# GonkRobot
Code and schematics for the Gonk droid inspired robot with tactile feet.

This makes use of code from the <a href="https://github.com/shepai/OpenEduBot/tree/main/PCBs">OpenEduBot dexBug board</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/shepai/TactileSensor">Robot tactile foot </a> repositories.  THough you can use whatever boards you want and change out the code in the <a href="https://github.com/shepai/GonkRobot/blob/main/Code/GonkController.py">gonk controller</a> code for your servo drivers, sd card readers ect... 

The robot makes use of an SD card for memory, four servos for movement, MPU6050 for 3D information, custom tactile sensors on the feet and LED eyes for character.
